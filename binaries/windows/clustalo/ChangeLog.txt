2010-06-17 Release 0.0.1 (Dubliniensis)
		
		First "release" as program has been able for a while to perform
		all basic tasks without problems.

		Non-standard features already built-in include:
		HMM-iteration (using HMMER for building an HMM) and guide-tree
		iteration. On top of that HMM input works fine and
		background-frequencies are added to the HHalign process.
		
		Known issues: RNA/DNA alignment is considered buggy. Aligned
		sequences have to be dealigned for HHalign to work properly.
		
		The HMMER version message can be ignored if no HMM-iteration
		was used.
