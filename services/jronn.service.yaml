description: 
  'JRONN is a Java implementation of RONN. JRONN is based on RONN and uses the 
	same model data, therefore gives the same predictions. Main motivation 
	behind JRONN development was providing an implementation of RONN more 
	suitable to use by the automated analysis pipelines and web services.  
	Original version of RONN is described in Yang,Z.R., Thomson,R., 
	McMeil,P. and Esnouf,R.M. (2005) RONN: the bio-basis function neural network
	technique applied to the detection of natively disordered regions in proteins
